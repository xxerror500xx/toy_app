# toy_app
This is another application built from [railstutorial.org](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/toy_app). This is the second of three applications to be made from the tutorial.

[final product](https://pure-river-25532.herokuapp.com/)

This application will be focusing on the following:
  - [Github](github.com) (i decided to use instead of bitbucket might move all of these tut apps to it eventually)
  - A simple database use case
  - Models, Views, and Controllers(MVC)
  - Routing
  - Rails Magic, Scaffolding and generators
  - REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
  - ActiveRecord and relationship management
  - Rails Console
  - Basic inheritance hierarchies
  - [Heroku](heroku.com)

## My Lessons Learned from this tutorial
* Learned allot more about the rake command $ rake -T
* Thought of some clever fake user names and emails...
